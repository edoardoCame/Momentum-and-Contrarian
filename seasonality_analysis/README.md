## 🛠️ Installation & Dependencies

### **Core Requirements**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

```bash
pip install plotly jupyter-lab
```

### **Python Version**
- **Required**: Python 3.8+

## 🎓 Technical Details

### **Seasonality Calculation**
```python
def calculate_monthly_seasonality(returns_data):
    """
    Calculate average monthly returns for each commodity
    
    1. Group returns by calendar month
    2. Calculate mean return for each month
    3. Apply statistical tests for significance
    4. Return results with month names as index
    """
```

### **Statistical Testing Method**
- **Test Type**: Welch's t-test (unequal variances)
- **Null Hypothesis**: Monthly returns = Overall average returns  
- **Alternative**: Monthly returns ≠ Overall average returns
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.05 (95% confidence)
- **Multiple Testing**: Individual tests per month-commodity pair

### **Bias Prevention**
- ✅ **No lookahead bias** - All calculations use historical data only
- ✅ **Proper temporal separation** - Returns calculated from close-to-close
- ✅ **Statistical rigor** - Appropriate test selection and significance levels
- ✅ **Data validation** - Automatic quality checks and outlier detection

## 📚 Educational Value

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### **Research Limitations**
- ❗ **Gross returns only** - Transaction costs not included

- ❗ **Sample period** - Results specific to 2010-2025 timeframe
- ❗ **Statistical significance** - 7.8% hit rate requires careful interpretation

### **Risk Warnings**
- 📈 **Past performance ≠ future results**
- 🎲 **Seasonal patterns can change** due to market evolution
- 💰 **Position sizing critical** for risk management
- ⚖️ **Multiple testing** increases false positive risk

## 🤝 Usage Examples

### **Find Best Seasonal Periods**
```python
# Get seasonal summary
results = analyzer.get_seasonal_summary_stats(returns_data)

# Identify commodities with strongest seasonality
seasonal_strength = results['seasonal_strength']
top_seasonal = seasonal_strength.nlargest(5)

print("Top 5 Most Seasonal Commodities:")
for commodity, strength in top_seasonal.items():
    sector = analyzer.sector_mapping[commodity]
    print(f"{commodity} ({sector}): {strength*100:.1f}% seasonal spread")
```

### **Sector Rotation Analysis**
```python
# Get sector-based seasonality
sector_patterns = results['sector_seasonality']

# Find best months for each sector
for sector in sector_patterns.columns:
    best_month = sector_patterns[sector].idxmax()
    best_return = sector_patterns[sector].max() * 100
    print(f"{sector} sector best in {best_month}: {best_return:+.2f}%")
```

### **Statistical Significance Check**
```python
# Get significance results
significance = results['statistical_significance']

# Find statistically significant patterns
p_values = significance[[col for col in significance.columns if '_pvalue' in col]]
significant_patterns = (p_values < 0.05).sum()

print("Significant seasonal patterns by commodity:")
for commodity, count in significant_patterns.items():
    clean_name = commodity.replace('_pvalue', '')
    print(f"{clean_name}: {count}/12 months significant")
```
